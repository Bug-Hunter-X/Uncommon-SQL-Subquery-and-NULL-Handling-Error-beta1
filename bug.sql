The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause, which is not supported by all SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL).  It also has a potential issue with the `WHERE` clause if `users.id` can be `NULL`. 
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE country = 'USA') AS users_usa WHERE users_usa.id > 10;
```

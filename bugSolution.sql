The improved query uses a common table expression (CTE) for better readability and explicitly handles potential `NULL` values:
```sql
WITH users_usa AS (
    SELECT id, name
    FROM users
    WHERE country = 'USA'
)
SELECT * 
FROM users_usa
WHERE users_usa.id > 10;
```

Alternative using JOIN (more efficient for large datasets):
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name
FROM users u
WHERE u.country = 'USA' AND u.id > 10;
```
